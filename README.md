## 1.3 Project Title
`Hands Off`

## 1.4 One-Line Pitch
`[A two-player cooperative game where players must use strings to smoothly extract a bomb from a robotic claw before it detects their movement and snaps shut.]`

## 1.5 Expanded Project Idea
In 1–2 paragraphs, explain:
- what your project is,
- what kind of playful experience it creates,
- what makes it fun, curious, engaging, strange, satisfying, competitive, or delightful,
- what technologies are involved.

**Response:**  
"THE CLAW SNATCHER" is a physical tabletop game inspired by the tension of bomb-defusal or the classic "Operation" game. At the center of the table sits an open, geometric MDF claw mechanism. Inside rests a 3D-printed artifact. Two players must each take one end of a string, loop it through the artifact, and lift it straight up together.

The twist? It's not just about lifting it; it's about smoothness. An ultrasonic sensor hidden beneath the artifact measures the variation in distance. If the players' hands shake, or if they try to yank the object out abruptly, the ESP32 microcontroller registers the sudden jump in speed and fires two servo motors simultaneously, slamming the heavy claws shut to trap the object (and potentially their strings). It's a test of communication, steady hands, and nerve, enhanced by a Bluetooth "Game Master" app that lets a third person secretly arm or manually trigger the trap.

# 2. Philosophy Fit

## 2.1 Experience, Not Social Problem
This module does **not** require your project to solve a large social problem.

You are allowed to build:
- toys,
- games,
- interactive objects,
- playful machines,
- kinetic artifacts,
- humorous devices,
- strange but delightful experiences,
- things that are entertaining to use or watch.

## 2.2 What kind of experience are you creating?
Answer the following:
- What is the experience?
- What do you want the player or participant to feel?
- Why would someone want to try it again?

**Response:**  
`[We are creating a high-stakes, nerve-wracking cooperative experience. We want the players to feel the physical tension of trying to stay perfectly still while coordinating with a partner. They will want to try it again because the failure condition is immediate and dramatic (the loud SNAP of the claws), triggering a "let's try one more time, I know we can do it smoother" response.]`

## 2.3 Design Persona
Complete the sentence below:

> We are designing this project as if we are a small creative studio making a **[toy / game / playable object / interactive experience]** for **[children / teens / adults / classmates / exhibition visitors / mixed audience]**.

**Response:**  
`[We are designing this project as if we are a small creative studio making a playable tabletop object for our classmates and exhibition visitors.Write here]`

# 3. Inspiration

## 3.1 References
List what inspired the project.

| Source Type | Title / Link | What Inspired You |
|---|---|---|
| `[Movie Scene]` | `[Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark (Idol Scene)]` | `[The concept of replacing/stealing an object off a weight/pressure plate without triggering the environment.]` |
| `[Toy / Board game / App / Video / Website / Object]` | `[Link or title]` | `[What did you learn or borrow?]` |
| `[Toy / Board game / App / Video / Website / Object]` | `[Link or title]` | `[What did you learn or borrow?]` |

## 3.2 Original Twist
What makes your project original?

**Response:**  
`[Instead of a simple "distance" trigger (like a motion sensor light), our trap uses an algorithm to calculate acceleration/smoothness. You are allowed to move the object, but if the current_distance minus the previous_distance exceeds our 2.5cm threshold in a fraction of a second, the trap fires.]`

---

# 4. Project Intent

## 4.1 Core Interaction Loop
Describe the main loop of interaction.

Examples:
- press → launch → score → reset
- connect → control → observe → repeat
- turn → trigger → react → repeat
- move object → sensor detects → sound/light response → player reacts

**Response:**  
`[Loop string into object -> Communicate -> Lift smoothly and slowly -> Win (if lifted past 15cm) OR Lose (sensor detects variation and snaps claw) -> Reset via thonny.]`

## 4.2 Intended Player / Audience

| Question | Response |
|---|---|
| Who is this for? | `[Anyone who enjoys physical puzzle/skill games.]` |
| Age range | `[10+ (Requires fine motor skills)]` |
| Solo or multiplayer | `[2-Player Co-op ]` |
| Expected duration of one round | `[30 to 60 seconds]` |
| What should the player feel? | `[Anxiety, focus, and then sudden shock or relief.]` |
| Is explanation required before use? | `[Yes, a brief 10-second explanation of the "smoothness" rule.]` |

## 4.3 Player Journey
Describe exactly how a player will use the project.

1. **Approach:** `[Players see the open wooden claw with the glowing artifact resting inside.]`
2. **Start:** `[The Game Master uses the app to "Arm" the trap.]`
3. **First Action:** `[Players carefully thread their hooks/strings into the artifact's side rings.]`
4. **Main Interaction:** `[Players pull the strings taut and slowly lift upwards, talking to each other to keep the object perfectly level.]`
5. **System Response:** `[The ultrasonic sensor pings the object 10 times a second, measuring the speed of the lift.]`
6. **Win / Lose / End Condition:** `[If they lift it 15cm high smoothly, they win. If they twitch, the claw snaps shut instantly.]`
7. **Reset:** `[Game Master hits "Reset" on the app, servos open the claws, and the object is placed back inside.]`

## 4.4 Rules of Play
If your project is a game, list the rules clearly.

- `[Rule 1: Players must use only the provided strings, no hands inside the claw zone.]`
- `[Rule 2: The lift must be perfectly smooth. Sudden yanks trigger the trap.]`
- `[Rule 3: If the claw closes and traps the object, the round is a failure.]`
- `[Rule 4]`

- app interaction if any.

**Response:**  
`[The project is an electromechanical trap. An ultrasonic sensor sits at the base, looking straight up at an object. An ESP32 reads this sensor every 100ms. If the variation in distance spikes, the ESP32 sends a PWM signal to two SG90 servos. The servos are connected to MDF claws via rigid wire pushrods. When the servos rotate, they push the rods, snapping the claws shut. An MIT App Inventor app connects to the ESP32 via BLE to send Arm/Disarm signals.]`

## 6.3 Input / Output Map

| System Part | Type | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| `[HC-SR04 Ultrasonic]` | Input | `[Constantly measures the height of the object.]` |
| `[ESP32]` | Processing | `[Calculates speed variation, filters glitches, handles BLE.]` |

- [x] Linkages
- [x] Hinges
- [ ] Shafts
- [ ] Springs
- [ ] Bearings
- [ ] Wheels
- [ ] Sliders
- [ ] Levers
- [ ] Not applicable

## 8.2 Mechanical Description
Describe the mechanism and what it is meant to do.

**Response:**  
`[We moved away from a "string and elastic" tendon mechanism because pulling heavy MDF was too difficult and caused the claws to open slowly. We switched to a Rigid Pushrod Mechanism. Stiff metal wire connects the servo horn to the inner edge of the claw. When the servo rotates to 90 degrees, it rigidly pushes the claw shut; returning to 0 degrees pulls it open.]`

## 8.3 Motion Planning
If something moves, explain:
- what moves,
- what causes the movement,
- how far it moves,
- how fast it moves,
- what could go wrong.

**Response:**  
`[Two servos actuate. Each servo pushes a stiff wire 2cm outward. This linear push against a 45-degree angled base hinge causes the 10cm MDF claw to arc inward by about 60 degrees, meeting in the center to form a cage.]`

## 8.4 Simulation / CAD / Animation Before Making
If your project includes mechanical motion, document the digital planning before fabrication.

# 18. Final Outcome

## 18.1 Final Description
Describe the final version of your project.

**Response:**  
`[We successfully built "Hands Off". The final physical model uses a laser-cut hexagonal base with two large, hinged MDF claws. The artifact sits centrally over the HC-SR04. The dual-servo pushrod mechanism is incredibly snappy and violent (in a fun way), making the failure condition very satisfying. The Game Master app connects flawlessly via BLE.]`

## 18.2 What Works Well
- `[Point 1 The acceleration logic. It feels perfectly tuned to catch shaky hands.]`
- `[Point 2 The dual-servo pushrod mechanism. It handles the heavy MDF with ease.]`
- `[Point 3]`

## 18.3 What Still Needs Improvement
- `[Point 1 The HC-SR04 sensor sometimes catches the side of the claw if it isn't aligned perfectly.]`
- `[Point 2]`
- `[Point 3]`

## 18.4 What Changed From the Original Plan
How did the project change from the initial idea?

**Response:**  
`[We originally planned to use an artist's wooden mannequin hand and use fishing line tendons. We realized the wood was too heavy and the internal elastics were too stiff for our SG90 servos. We pivoted to designing our own geometric MDF claws and using a rigid pushrod linkage instead, which ultimately looked better and functioned 100x more reliably.]`

# 19. Reflection

## 19.1 Team Reflection
What did your team do well?  
What slowed you down?  
How well did you manage time, tasks, and responsibilities?

**Response:**  
`[Write here]`

## 19.2 Technical Reflection
What did you learn about:
- electronics,
- coding,
- mechanisms,
- fabrication,
- integration?

**Response:**  
`[The biggest lesson was understanding Power and Ground. Learning that microcontrollers can "brown out" when motors pull too much current, and discovering that an external power supply won't work unless it shares a Ground line with the data source, was a massive "aha" moment that saved our project. Also, writing code that measures delta (change over time) rather than just absolute values made the sensor feel much "smarter."]`

## 19.3 Design Reflection
What did you learn about:
- designing for play,
- delight,
- clarity,
- physical interaction,
- player understanding,
- iteration?

**Response:**  
`[Write here]`

## 19.4 If You Had One More Week
What would you improve next?

**Response:**  
`[We would add a Capacitive Touch sensor (using copper tape) to the MDF claws, so that if the player's string accidentally brushes against the sides of the claw while lifting, it triggers the trap, adding a second layer of difficulty to the extraction!]`
